# DeepRNA

Application to predict RNA structures from sequences. The sequences are synthetically created and a Deep Neural Network is trained to predict the secondary RNA structure from a sequence. A single RNA strand can can fold into millions of secondary RNA structures. A better structure is categorized by having minimum energy. The project is more focussed on tuning the hyper parameters to increase the prediction accuracy.
